"1664",1664,-8,"Negative","05/06/11","NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Media reports saying Greece is considering withdrawing from the euro pushed the euro down against the dollar and other major currencies in midday trading Friday, analysts said. The report was on Spiegel Online. ""This is making everyone extremely nervous,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda Corp. ""It's weighing on euro sentiment and could have huge ramifications if they actually do it."" It could happen because the peripheral countries want to escape the expensive bailouts they've had to take, and countries doing the bailing out would also like not having to finance them, he said.

Issues with peripheral debt have tended to blow over periodically, but the euro is likely to again find support from expectations of more interest-rate hikes for the region, Popplewell said."

Trump's comments are uncomfortable to investors as it called the Fed's independence from the government into question.

Trump said he wasn't ""thrilled"" with the central bank's interest-rate raises which have pushed the federal-funds rate to a range of 1.75% and 2%, with further hikes penciled in possibly for September and December. The Fed has raised rates twice thus far in 2018. ""Because we go up and every time you go up they want to raise rates again.

Trump nominated Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to his current post, replacing Janet Yellen. It is unusual for an acting U.S. president to criticize the actions of the central bank, which is considered an independent entity. Trump's gripe appears to be that fiscal-policies enacted in late 2017, including corporate tax cuts, are being undone by rate hikes, which can raise borrowing costs for companies and consumers, since the Fed's actions help set the rates for everything from mortgages and car loans to corporate debt. The Fed's strategy, started before Powell, is to remove ultralow monetary policy that has been accommodative to growth and put in place to avert a deep collapse of the global market wrought by toxic asset-backed securities. Now, the Fed fears inflated asset prices unnatural as the economy has shown marked signs of health more than a decade after the financial crisis took hold. The Fed has struggled to balance returning to normal while not disrupting the economy's expansion. Trump told Kernen that he's letting the Fed do what it sees fit but ""at the same time,""he said, ""I don't like all of this work that's going in to this economy,"" while rates keep going up."

December gold 
        GCZ8
       was up $16.30, or 1.4%, at $1,208.10 an ounce. A settlement around this level would be the highest since Aug. 29. Moreover, a close above $1,207.44 an ounce would represent the first time a most-active contract has closed above a short-term trend line since April 20, according to FactSet data. Technical analysts watch moving averages to help gauge bullish and bearish momentum in an asset. Tuesday's climb for gold comes as traders focus on political jitters in Italy over fundamental factors that should otherwise capsize gains for the yellow metal. Investors have sought havens amid fears centered on a controversial budget plan rolled out by the antiestablishment Italian government. Last week, Italian officials proposed a budget deficit target of 2.4% of its gross domestic product, which was wider than expected and has put the country's leadership on a collision course with the European Union and threatens to roil markets. Still, buying appetite for assets perceived as risky continued apace, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average

According to the news channel, JPMorgan, under CEO Jamie Dimon, is preparing to unfurl JPM Coin, a proprietary currency engineered by the bank's technology group. CNBC said that project is being headed by Umar Farooq, JPMorgan's head of blockchain. All of the use cases for JPM Coin aren't entirely clear, but Farooq told CNBC in an interview that its application could be wide-ranging. The so-called JPM Coin is pegged to the U.S. dollar

       and could be used as a vehicle for international payments. Wall Street companies have long toyed with the idea of using the blockchain, or distributed-ledger technology that underpins most crypotcurrencies, to track trades and help create efficiencies in their businesses. However, few, if any, have effectively rolled out a real-world use for blockchain or cryptocurrencies. The move by JPMorgan comes even as bitcoin 
        BTCUSD,
        -2.35%,
       one of the most popular digital currencies in the world, has seen its value crumble by more than 80% since its peak near $20,000 in late 2017 to its current price at around $3,500. Proponents of digital coins, a group viewed as comprising antiestablishment and anti-Wall Street players, have been awaiting increased adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrencies by traditional businesses. Some on Wall Street have been hoping for an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, backed by digital currencies to debut, but none among the handful currently seeking approval has been given the regulatory green light. For his part, Dimon has referred to bitcoin as a ""fraud"" but has said he sees utility in blockchain. A call to a JPMorgan official wasn't immediately returned. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has seen its shares climb 5.6% so far in 2019, underperforming the broader market, with the S&P 500 index

What happened: Investors started the day on edge but some skittish buying took hold as market participants parsed a surge in U.S. gross domestic product, which climbed by a 33.1% annual rate-recovering about two-thirds of the ground it lost at heart of the coronavirus pandemic. A tightening presidential election race was also partially blamed for Wednesday's selloff. Democratic challenger Joe Biden's continues to lead President Donald Trump in the polls, but the race has tightened and a survey released this week showed Trump moving ahead of Biden in Florida, a battleground state. Meanwhile, rising coronavirus cases in Europe and the US. have clouded the economic outlook. 


The numbers: The Dow Jones Industrial Average 
        DJIA
       closed the session with a 139 point gain, up 0.5%, to close at 26, 659, recovering a portion of the 943-point tumble from Wednesday. Apple Inc. 
        AAPL,
       Chevron 
        CVX
       and Disney

        WBA
       and UnitedHealth Group Inc. 
        UNH
       led losing shares on the Dow. The S&P 500 index

       closed up 1.2% at 3,310, after a 3.5% loss a day ago. The energy sector 
        XLE
       led the way higher, over 3%, while the health care sector 
        XLV
       led losses, off 0.5%. The Nasdaq Composite Index

       closed 1.6% higher, following its 3.7% fall on Wednesday, to end at 11,186. 

All closing levels are on a preliminary basis. 



What drove the market: Wall Street may look at Wednesday's decline as an opportunity to tepidly dip into stocks that have been beaten down over the past several sessions. Moreover, investors also may not want to be caught flatfooted ahead of earnings from Facebook Inc.

       added $21.60, or 1.2%, to settle at $1,753.30 an ounce, following a 0.3% gain on Tuesday. Data on consumer prices showed that inflation in July remained at up 5.4% for the second straight month, marking a 20-year high, the Labor Department said Tuesday. Meanwhile, the consumer price index climbed 0.5% on a month-over-month basis last month, but down from 0.9% in June and it matched the expectations of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. The closely watched measure of inflation that omits volatile food and energy - the so-called core price index - rose 0.3%, below expectations for a 0.4% gain, and the 12-month rate decelerated to 4.3% from 4.5%, which was a 29-year high.

The widespread availability of vaccines in the U.S., the U.K., and most European Union nations is helping to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on those economies. Meanwhile, the unleashing of pent-up consumer demand, coupled with supply shortages, has sent inflation higher in the U.S., a trend being seen across much of the developed world, according to Ebury, a London-based provider of currency solutions. 

The more-than-$6-trillion-a-day currency market operates around the clock, with a breadth and liquidity that few other markets can match and the potential to impact other asset classes, like stocks, bonds and commodities. It’s especially adept at quickly sizing up multiple developments across geographical regions, such as the “supercycle” demand for commodities earlier this year that led to greater interest in commodity-linked currencies.

“With concerns surrounding the virus abating, aside from localized flare ups in infection caused by the delta variant, we think that the main driver of the major currencies in the second half of the year will be how central banks respond to rising inflationary pressures,” Ebury’s Chief Risk Officer Enrique Diaz-Alvarez, along with analysts Matthew Ryan and Roman Ziruk, wrote in a note this week.

The British pound 
        GBPUSD,
        -1.44%
       should be able to post “reasonable gains” over the U.S. dollar through next year, considering that the Bank of England is likely to normalize its policy sooner than either the Federal Reserve or European Central Bank, they said. Almost all of the virus restrictions in England have been removed, allowing the U.K. economy to outperform most of its major peers this year, and the first BOE interest rate hike of 15 basis points could come around next May or August, according to Ebury.

Meanwhile, the firm remains bearish on the dollar, which should depreciate “versus most of its peers over our forecast horizon” — and Ebury doesn’t expect the recent spike in U.S. inflation to be particularly lasting. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index 
        DXY,
        +0.94%,
       a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals,  was marginally lower on Wednesday. 

The bearish view is predicated on two things, according to Ryan, a senior market analyst. Besides being “generally optimistic about the global economic recovery,” he said in a follow-up e-mail to MarketWatch, “we also think that the FOMC will take a rather cautious approach to raising interest rates given the rather strong political pressure against tightening. We do not think that the Fed will begin hiking rates until late-2022 at the very earliest, which may put it behind the curve in relation to more than half of its G10 peers.”
 
Ebury sees the GBP/USD pair climbing to 1.45 by the end of 2022, versus around 1.38 as of Wednesday.   

As for the euro 
        EURUSD,
        -0.95%,
       the ECB’s more dovish tone has caused the market “to push back” expectations for policy normalization and sent the euro to its lowest level against the dollar in four months. The recent move lower in the EUR/USD “has perhaps been excessive,” and a likely convergence in the economic performances of the U.S. and euro area in the current quarter “should support the euro in the near-term,” according to Ebury. Still, inflation pressures in the euro area are lagging and the ECB seems to be in no rush to normalize its policy, causing Ebury to revise its near-term EUR/USD forecasts lower.

To be sure, the coronavirus is still very much on the minds of traders with regard to currencies like the New Zealand dollar.  On Wednesday, the kiwi 
        NZDUSD,
        -0.23%
       continued to slide after the island country placed its largest city, Auckland, into lockdown following the first case of Covid-19 in the community since February.  In addition, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand left its policy rate unchanged at a record low, given the virus outbreak.

And back in the U.S., the pandemic weighed on equities this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average 
        DJIA,
        -2.73%
       and S&P 500 Indexes 
        SPX,
        -2.91%
       held steady Wednesday after having dropped on weaker-than-expected retail sales yesterday that some analysts linked to the spreading delta variant.

“Countries that have the luxury of vaccines and successful rollouts are the exceptions,” Marc Chandler, managing director of Bannockburn Global Forex, said via phone. “In some places, like New Zealand, Australia and southeast Asia, the virus is still affecting policy.” Even so, “the market expects policy makers in the U.S.,  U.K.  and Europe to look past the rise of Covid-19 cases and to focus on policy.”"

Given extremely low bond yields and high stock valuations, “any major change in inflation will hit both parts of the portfolio,” CEO Nicolai Tangen of Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway’s $1.4 trillion sovereign fund, told Bloomberg Television in an interview.  “In the past, it’s been one and not the other. But this time, both can move in the same direction.”

That’s the view of analysts at TD Securities, who see the U.S. Dollar Index  
        DXY,
        +0.94%
        consolidating through the end of 2022 to 89.0, versus 92.9 on Thursday. They see the U.S. central bank looking past the recent inflation shock and erring on the side of continuing to support economic growth, which would limit how much the greenback can rally. TD’s forecast for the dollar index is a bit below the consensus estimate of 91.80.

The almost $7 trillion-a-day global currency market, which operates around the clock, is currently grappling with the conflict between slowing worldwide economic growth and a greater intention by central banks to withdraw monetary stimulus, albeit at varying speeds, as the recovery from the pandemic proceeds. The dollar is caught in that tug-of-war between those competing narratives, trading within relatively narrow ranges since June, ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting next week. 

Read: Global currency market seen as the premiere way to trade central banks’ pandemic-era policy divergence 

“Monetary policy is going to remain fairly static at the Fed, with the central bank sidelined from a hiking perspective into 2022,” Mazen Issa, a senior currency strategist at TD Securities in New York, said via phone Thursday. “The important feature to note about tapering is that it kicks off the debate about liftoff. That will really animate the risks around the dollar going forward.” 

Meanwhile, policy makers worldwide are generally moving at “a glacial pace” with an intent to ultimately unwind the stimulus provided during the pandemic, he said. “But if everyone is moving in the same direction in incremental steps, that should mitigate significant directional impact on the dollar. “

The greenback began this year by defying widespread bets that it would drop in 2021 on a broad vaccination-led global recovery and stimulus-fueled expansion of the U.S. deficit. 

In a turnabout of thinking by analysts and traders, the U.S.’s massive fiscal and monetary stimulus relative to the rest of the world, and the notion of “American exceptionalism”, were instead seen as likely to burnish the dollar’s appeal. 

Ordinarily, the dollar trends higher when U.S. interest rates go up or policy makers hint that they will. In June, for example, the greenback got a lift after an unexpected shift in the Fed’s outlook that suggested policy makers were taking the prospects of higher inflation more seriously than many had thought. 

But since then, for the past three months, the U.S. currency has traded in a confined range. One big reason is the emergence of the stagflation theme in markets, and another is that much of what happens to the dollar depends heavily on what else is going on in the rest of the world. For now, Europe “has started to gain an edge versus North America” when it comes to the change in growth expectations, and the dollar has moved to the bottom of the Group-of-10 currencies along with the Canadian loonie,  
        CADUSD,
        -0.64%
       according to a note earlier this week by Issa and TD Securities strategists Mark McCormick and Ray Ng.

They recommended buying the euro on dips and waiting for some form of “reflation-lite” trend to return this fall before buying the loonie. Any shift toward a “reflation-lite” scenario would also offer dip-buying opportunities in the U.S. dollar-yen pair 
        USDJPY,
        +0.03%,
       they said.

Much of the price action across currencies in the months to come will be driven not just by the economic backdrop, but by the lack of uniform responses to higher inflation from global central banks. In a separate note on Wednesday, James Rossiter, TD’s head of global macro strategy, said he sees room for error on multiple fronts by central banks.

Among some of the risks, he says, are that: central banks like those of Australia, Canada and England tighten monetary policy despite slowing growth; or that the Fed, European Central Bank and Sweden’s Riksbank delay tightening despite high inflation.

“Going forward, there’s going to be more variation in monetary policy,” TD’s Issa said. “So far, we’ve seen clusters of central banks moving around the same time. But into 2022, we’re going to start seeing how tolerant central banks are on the inflation front, and that could lead to more variation in policy.”"

"11862",11950,1,"Positive","09/30/21","The U.S. may be heading into an “era” in which inflation remains significantly higher on average over the next decade, according to London-based research firm Capital Economics.

In a note this week, John Higgins, its chief markets economist, puts a new spin on the inflation debate, by theorizing that price gains won’t necessarily climb sharply from here, or be accompanied by weaker economic growth and tighter monetary policy.  In that case, he says, markets won’t falter the way they have during past periods of high inflation.

The prospect of persistently higher inflation worldwide is gaining traction after the heads of the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan  acknowledged on Wednesday that the spike in price gains seen in many advanced countries this year may stay elevated for some time. Over the past week, worries about inflation and the prospect that the Fed might need to tighten monetary policy more aggressively down the road were factors behind the runup in Treasury yields, which caused stocks to falter and the U.S. Dollar Index to spike.

A crackdown on the energy sector in China, record energy prices in Europe and cargo pile-ups at California ports are some of the events that have once-complacent investors considering the notion of longer-lived priced gains, even if they haven’t been fully priced in yet. The forecast from Capital Economics goes further out than most firms’ expectations, while delving into the impact on bonds, stocks and currencies.

“We envisage a future in the US in which inflation is significantly higher than it has been in the past decade, but still only moderately above target; economic growth remains healthy as supply constraints ease; and the Fed doesn’t press very hard on the brakes,” Higgins wrote in a paper titled, “What would an era of higher inflation mean for markets?” 

His firm’s base-case view assumes that inflation will remain below 5% in most advanced economies and many emerging markets, though “the risks to this view lie more to the upside than the downside,” he said. The headline U.S. consumer price index rate could average around 3% later this decade, compared to the sub-2% level that prevailed over the 2010s. And U.S. monetary policy could remain “very accommodative” in the next few years, considering the Fed’s flexible average inflation targeting approach."
"11863",11951,1,"Positive","09/30/21","Gold futures ended higher on Thursday to snap a two-session skid that pulled the metal to its lowest settlement in about six months, but strength in the U.S. dollar and Treasury yields prompted prices to post losses for the month, as well as the quarter."

"11865",11953,-14,"Negative","10/01/21","For months prices have been rising as the U.S. economy has recovered from the COVID pandemic while financial markets have stayed priced for perfection and central banks have clung to the view that elevated inflation would likely subside in short order.

Now, fears about higher prices are coming to the fore, with BofA Global Research analysts declaring in a Friday note that “stagflation is here”  and a government report showing U.S. inflation still at a 30-year high as of August. Even central bankers appeared to be starting to capitulate this week, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell saying that high inflation could run into 2022. 

Rather than dissipating, price pressures are holding consistently firm and could be getting harder to dislodge as time goes on. At the moment, a global energy shortage is also unfolding across the U.K., Europe and China, shaking up investors previously distracted by COVID’s delta variant, the troubles of China’s Evergrande Group HK:3333, and the potential for a U.S. government shutdown along with the debt-ceiling debate.

Interestingly, inflation fears haven’t yet translated into sustained financial-market action, with bond and stock investors brushing aside Friday’s inflation data and the U.S. Dollar Index 
        DXY,
        +0.94%
       falling, after the past week’s sharp rise in yields, a stock-market selloff and advance in the dollar. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average

        -2.73%,
       S&P 500

        -3.52%
       indexes were heading higher, while Treasury yields were little changed from the two- to 10-year rate, which was trading around 1.48%.

But the recent, somewhat delayed reaction to the Fed’s hawkish pivot on Sept. 22 offers a glimpse of what might be still come: Treasury yields rose to the highest in months, stocks fell, and the dollar index soared to a roughly one-year high.

“This is the  first week that markets realized that global growth could be weak and inflation more persistent,” Athanasios Vamvakidis, BofA’s global head of G10 FX strategy, said via phone from London. “Energy-price increases were a wake-up call for markets, and the scenario that’s now more likely to develop is one in which we get higher inflation and weaker output.”

He sees the prospect of more “pronounced” financial market moves in 2022 than those of the past week.  His view is that stagflation is unfolding worldwide, but becoming more severe in the U.S. which could prompt policy makers to tighten monetary policy more aggressively than expected.

Stagflation is a word that conjures up images of 1970’s era double-digit inflation and long gasoline lines, so analysts have been loathe to use it. It’s a scenario that’s basically the worst of all worlds for the average person because it causes real incomes to stagnate or decline while destroying purchasing power.

The scenario currently being articulated by various banks like BofA is more of a stagflation-lite outcome, where inflation doesn’t need to necessarily shoot up much higher from here but lingers for far longer than previously thought. 

Vamvakidis says he envisions a scenario where U.S. inflation keeps surprising to the upside and economic growth surprises to the downside, relative to expectations. The core PCE index could stay above 3% into 2022, he says, leaving inflation high enough that the Fed and other central banks might need to tighten monetary policy more than expected at a time when output is weaker and risk asset prices may be volatile. Meanwhile, analysts at Capital Economics in London see an era of higher inflation in the U.S. that lasts for a decade.

“We could easily see inflation at 3% to 4% for a while,” said Gang Hu, managing partner of New York hedge fund WinShore Capital Partners, who trades global inflation-protected securities. “We are not at the end of this supply-side destruction and are entering a period where nobody knows what transitory inflation means.”

“Once this episode passes, I don’t rule out a chance of a prolonged period of deflation” as policy makers “overshoot on the other side,” Hu told MarketWatch Friday. “For now, the market has not lost its confidence in the central bank’s ability to control inflation.”"
